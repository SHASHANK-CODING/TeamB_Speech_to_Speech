# ðŸ“‘ Project Report â€“ Real-Time Speech Translator App

---

## 1. Introduction

This project implements a **real-time speech translation application** using **Azure Cognitive Services** and **Flask**.
The app supports **speech-to-text â†’ translation â†’ text-to-speech**, enabling real-time multilingual communication.

The main objective is to develop a **translation pipeline** for **OTT platforms**, sports commentary, and other real-time communication scenarios.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

* Enable **real-time translation** from **English/Hindi â†’ 12+ languages**.
* Provide **low-latency translations** suitable for live use.
* Maintain **contextual accuracy** (beyond word-to-word translation).
* Evaluate translation quality with **BLEU & BERTScore**.
* Deliver a model **ready for integration into a real-time pipeline**.

## 3. System Architecture

The system architecture is built on modular components:

    E --> H[Evaluation Metrics BLEU BERTScore Latency]

```

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Milestone 1 â€“ Speech Recognition

* Implemented **speech-to-text** pipeline using Azure STT.
* Captured live speech and generated transcripts.
* Stored transcripts for translation training.

### 4.2 Milestone 2 â€“ Translation Model

* Selected **Azure OpenAI-based models** for translation.
* Prepared dataset:

  * Collected transcripts from Milestone 1.
  * Added reference translations using APIs & dictionaries.
  * Cleaned data (removed noise, normalized formatting).
* Fine-tuned translation pipeline for **OTT + sports domain**.
* Implemented evaluation metrics:

  * **BLEU Score** â€“ Accuracy compared to references.
  * **BERTScore** â€“ Semantic similarity across languages.
  * **Latency Measurement** â€“ Ensured real-time translation (<2s).

### 4.3 Milestone 3 â€“ Integration (Upcoming)

* Optimize pipeline for **continuous real-time input**.
* Build **streaming translation** with Flask WebSockets.
* Deploy as a **web-based live translator service**.

## 5. Flow of Execution

1. **Speech Input** â€“ User speaks into microphone.
2. **Speech-to-Text** â€“ Azure STT converts audio to text.
3. **Translation** â€“ Azure Translator converts text to multiple target languages.
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Translation is checked with BLEU/BERTScore.
5. **Output** â€“ Results are displayed & converted back to speech.

## 6. Code Overview

### pipeline_process()

* Handles **speech recognition â†’ translation â†’ save history**.
* Uses Azure Translator for multilingual output.
* Saves results to `translations.json`.

### load_history()

* Loads past translation history for review.

### Flask Routes

* `/` â†’ Home page (index.html).
* `/translate` â†’ Accepts speech, translates, returns results.
* `/download` â†’ Exports translations as `.txt` or `.zip`.

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric        | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BLEU**      | Measures how close translation is to reference text     |
| **BERTScore** | Checks semantic similarity between translations         |
| **Latency**   | Time taken for live translation                         |
| **Accuracy**  | Ensures proper handling of names, numbers, domain terms |

Results (Milestone 2):

* BLEU Score: **High** for general sentences.
* BERTScore: **>0.85** for semantic accuracy.
* Latency: **~1.5s average per translation**.
* Accuracy: Proper translation of OTT/sports terms.

---

## 8. Deliverables (Milestone 2)

* Translation model (English/Hindi â†’ 12+ languages).
* Dataset preparation & cleaning process.
* Evaluation results (BLEU, BERTScore, latency).
* Integration-ready pipeline for Milestone 3.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The **Real-Time Speech Translator App** successfully demonstrates:

* Accurate and low-latency translations.
* Domain-specific adaptation (OTT, sports).
* Readiness for real-time deployment in the next milestone.

This project provides a foundation for live speech-to-speech translation systems, bridging communication across multiple languages.
